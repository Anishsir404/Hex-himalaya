The challenge title includes the word 'Base,' hinting that the encrypted text might be decoded using popular base decoding methods. However, despite attempting to decode the message using different techniques, no sensible information was obtained.

After researching bit more about Base encoding methods, I stumbled upon an base encoding technique `base65536`

decrypting the given encrypted text.
