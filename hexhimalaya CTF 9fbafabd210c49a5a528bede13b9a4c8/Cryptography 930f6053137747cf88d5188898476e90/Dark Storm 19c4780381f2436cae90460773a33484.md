I downloaded the given image and searched in google in hope of finding the encoding format. Luckily I found out it was encoded in “HexaHue” encoding format. On decoding this value in the site → [https://www.dcode.fr/hexahue-cipher](https://www.dcode.fr/hexahue-cipher)

I decoded the given image and got the value - DGT TZ EAA FOQGV

Adding this as Flag gave the wrong result, therefore I checked the keyword “Beaufort”, Checking this for encoding format, I found the “Beaufort Cipher” too, also the “HEX” keyword was in Capital, so i thought It might had to do something with the Decoding.

Here, the decoded value didn’t give any meaningful result, therefore I decided to add “HEX” keyword as key. On doing so, I got the flag.
