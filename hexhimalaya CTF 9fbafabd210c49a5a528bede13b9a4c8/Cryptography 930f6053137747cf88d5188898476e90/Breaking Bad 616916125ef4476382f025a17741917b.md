Two passcodes were given in the above challenge and according to the hint it was related with periodic tables.

First step was to get the elements of number present in the passcode and leave the strings as it is.

We  got the following strings now

```jsx
H AD I EG RH PO Y TI E N T O I A P L

H PR I AG NH PO AT V E N T P I TA L
```

After removing the non matching letters from above strings we got the flag which becomes

```jsx
H I G H PO T E N T I A L
H I G H PO T E N T I A L
```
