Acc. to the name of the challenge I thought this might had to do something with changing the value of Admin to True or something like that.

On randomly checking the “robots.txt” file I found an “/admin.html” site.

On checking the cookies, there was nothing in the login page. I added “admin:admin” in the login page. It resulted showing Invalid credential and asked to log in as Admin. I got redirected to “denied.html” as well.

On checking the cookies after logging, I got the following result with the “admin” value being “false”.

Though changing the value to “True” and reloading the page didn’t take me anywhere.

On keeping the value of “admin” as “true”, I randomly tried going back to the login page and again added the same login credential and tried logging in. This time i got redirected to “panel.html” instead of “denied.html” and got the flag in the “panel.html” page.
