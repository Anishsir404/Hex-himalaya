After we get password we see:

```powershell

```

After copying the text into another text editor we see this.

So, we were at a rabbit hole now let’s unzip another file.

we see so many files. Let’s look at the file type of all the files.

we see one different file i.e. File-LFGvo.txt

but it has nothing on further we find other file File-c4rful.txt.
