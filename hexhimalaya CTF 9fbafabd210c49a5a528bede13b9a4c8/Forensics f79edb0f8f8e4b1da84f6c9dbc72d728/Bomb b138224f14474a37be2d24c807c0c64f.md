On downloading the zip file, I tried unzipping it. Unzipping the first zip file “Zipped2048.zip”, it extracted another zip file “Zipped2047.zip”. So I concluded that I had to unzip all the 2048 zip files. Therefore I crafted the following python file that could unzip all the zip files and gave the final file.

Python file.

```
import zipfile
import os

def unzip_recursive(zip_file_path):
    while os.path.exists(zip_file_path):
        # Extract the zip file
        with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_file_path, 'r') as zip_ref:
            zip_ref.extractall()

        # Delete the zip file after extracting its contents
        os.remove(zip_file_path)

        # Get a list of files extracted from the zip
        extracted_files = os.listdir()

        # Look for nested zip files and continue unzipping
        for file in extracted_files:
            if file.endswith('.zip'):
                print(f"Unzipping {file}...")
                unzip_recursive(file)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Replace '248.zip' with the path to your initial zip file
    initial_zip_file = "/home/aayush/himalaya/Zipped2048.zip"
    unzip_recursive(initial_zip_file)
```

Unzipping all the file, I got the final file “nicetry.txt” which had flag in it.
